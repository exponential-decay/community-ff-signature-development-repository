#Digital Preservation File Format Signature Development Repository

A repository for others to contribute to, for file format signature development research.

I have not labelled the repository with a tool, e.g. DROID, as it can be used to develop work for mime-info, and File, and other tools alike. 

Contributors should contribute by pull request, I can also grant them access to the repository. 

Proposed Process:

1. Create a new folder by contributor name or organisation
2. Create a sub-folder with an umbrella name for the types of file underneath, e.g. 'Archives-New-Zealand/DAT-Files'
