The NIFTI (Neuroimaging InFormatics Technology Initiative) format is used for the storage of images created during brain-related research. It is an adaptation of the ANALYZE 7.5 format.

Two versions exist, each with two variants.

For version 1, the NI1 format is a 348 byte header '.hdr' that describes image data stored in a corresponding '.img' file.

The N+1 format stores both the header and image information in a single '.nii' file.

For version 2, the NI2 format is a 540 byte header '.hdr' that describes image data stored in a corresponding '.img' file.

The N+2 format stores both the header and image information in a single '.nii' file.

Sample files are from the [NIH NIfTI Data Format Working Group](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/)
