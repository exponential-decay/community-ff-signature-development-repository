ACS is file format created by Microsoft to store assets for its Microsoft Agent Characters like Clippy, Merlin, and Peedy. The ACS format stores data about the character, animations using a custom compression scheme, and text phrases in multiple languages.

An [unofficial specification for ACS](MSAgentDataSpecification_v1_3.htm) was reverse engineered by [Remy Lebeau](http://www.lebeausoftware.org/).

Sample ACS files can be found in installations of Microsoft Office 1997, on the [MSAgent Webring](http://msagentring.org/), and on [Ponx](http://www.ponx.org/msagent/Acs/) in what seems to be a backup the now defunct agentry.org.

Documentation on how to create and edit Microsoft Agents is still available from [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms695797.aspx)
